# Regex in CenQL

Reference for the `=~` operator in Censys Platform queries. Source:
<https://docs.censys.com/docs/platform-regex-cenql> (retrieved 2026-08-05).
Hit counts below are historical examples, not current measurements.

Read this alongside the [CenQL syntax reference](censys_query_language.md) before writing regex. Submit queries through the hunting gateway within the case scope and remaining allowance.

## The operator

Use `=~` to match a pattern instead of an exact value. **`=~` is
case-sensitive.** There is no case-insensitivity switch — express it with
character classes (`[Ff]ish[Ee]ye`), never with an inline flag.

Regex queries require the relevant account entitlement. This harness retains per-query credit cost as unknown. Use available account context and provider documentation when assessing access; a successful metadata check alone does not establish regex access.

## Delimiters and escaping — the most common source of silent zeros

A pattern may be wrapped in **backticks** (a raw string) or in **double
quotes**. If you use double quotes you must **double-escape** special regex
characters.

Inside either delimiter, `\` escapes these characters:

```
.  +  ()  {}  []  "  *  ?  :  \  /  ^  $
```

**`"` is on that list.** A double quote inside a pattern must be written `\"`
even in a backtick-delimited raw string. Forget it and the query returns **0
hits with no error** — indistinguishable from "this product is not exposed".

Verified against the SonicWall SMA 1000 population:

| Pattern | Hits |
| --- | --- |
| ``body=~`class="ewcontent"` `` | **0** |
| ``body=~`class=\"ewcontent\"` `` | **1,577** |
| ``body=~`id="login_left"` `` | **1** |
| ``body=~`id=\"login_left\"` `` | **2,558** |
| ``body=~`login_left` `` (no quotes at all) | 36,017 |

This matters far more than it looks. Matching HTML attributes is one of the best
fingerprinting techniques available, because `id=\"login_left\"` is a specific
piece of one vendor's markup while the bare token `login_left` is a generic CSS
name shared by tens of thousands of unrelated login pages. Escaping the quotes
took a signal from unusable (36,017 hosts, ~93% noise) to a near-perfect
fingerprint (2,558 hosts, single `hardware.product` bucket). **Do not abandon a
quoted pattern that returns 0 — escape it and try again.**

Note that `=` and `%` are *not* on the escape list and work literally, which is
why a URL-encoded fragment such as ``body=~`product=SMA%201000%20Series` ``
needs no escaping at all.

## Anchors

Regex in CenQL is **not anchored** — a pattern matches if it appears anywhere in
the field value. Use `^` and `$` to anchor, but note the restriction: **they may
only appear as the first and last characters of the pattern.** You cannot anchor
mid-alternation.

| Query | Matches | Does not match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``web.hostname=~`\w{3}\.censys\.\w{3}` `` | `docs.censys.com`, `mail.censys.com.mx`, `www.censys.biz` | `app.censys.io` |
| ``web.hostname=~`^\w{3}\.censys\.\w{3}$` `` | `www.censys.com`, `app.censys.com`, `go2.censys.com` | `docs.censys.com`, `mail.censys.com.mx` |

## Supported operators and assertions

| Operator | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `\` | Escapes `.` `+` `()` `{}` `[]` `"` `*` `?` `:` `\` `/` `^` `$` |
| `.` | Any character |
| `+` | Preceding character one or more times |
| `*` | Preceding character zero or more times |
| `()` | Group — e.g. `(org\|com\|net\|biz\|xyz)`, `(exe\|py\|msi\|jar)` |
| `\|` | Alternation |
| `[]` | Any one character in the set; `-` for a range; leading `^` negates. `c[^e]nsys` matches `cansys` and `c0nsys`, not `censys` |
| `{}` | Repetition count. `c[^e]{3}nsys` matches `caaansys`. `e{2,4}` matches 2–4 `e` characters |
| `^` | Start-of-input assertion (first character only) |
| `$` | End-of-input assertion (last character only) |

## Character classes

| Class | Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `\w` | `[A-Za-z0-9_]` |
| `\W` | `[^A-Za-z0-9_]` |
| `\d` | `[0-9]` |
| `\D` | `[^0-9]` |
| `\s` | `[\t-\n\r ]` — space, tab, form feed, line feed, Unicode spaces |
| `\S` | `[^\t-\n\r ]` |

## What is NOT supported

- **Inline flags.** `(?i)`, `(?s)`, `(?is)` are absent from the operator table
  and return **0 hits silently**. Verified: ``value=~`Jetty` `` returns 199,543
  hosts, ``value=~`(?i)jetty` `` returns 0.
- **Lookarounds, backreferences, non-greedy quantifiers, `\b`.** None appear in
  the documented operator set. Treat anything beyond the tables above as
  unsupported until proven otherwise with a positive control.

## The positive-control rule

Every documented failure mode above produces **zero hits and no error message**.
A 0-hit regex is therefore ambiguous: it means either "not present in the data"
or "your pattern is malformed". You cannot tell which by looking.

Before using a zero result as a negative conclusion, check a retained known-positive example. Submit a new control only within the case scope and remaining allowance. A failing control leaves syntax, changed data, and coverage unresolved; it does not prove absence. If a control cannot be run, retain that limitation.

Check escaping of literal characters, inline flags, anchor position, and case. Escape literal punctuation without escaping operators that are intended to retain their regex meaning.

## Escaping in double-quoted patterns

The two delimiters are not interchangeable in escaping depth. Censys's own
example of a proxy-detection query uses double quotes with `.*,.*`, while the
Google-impersonation example needs `".*\\.google\\..*"` — a *doubled* backslash
for what would be a single `\.` in backticks.

**Prefer backticks.** One level of escaping is easier to reason about, and it is
the convention used in these syntax examples. Reserve double quotes for patterns you
are copying verbatim out of Censys documentation.

## Worked examples from the Censys docs

```
cert.names=~`.*\..*\.example\.com$`

host.services.endpoints.http.headers:(key="X-Forwarded-For" and value=~".*,.*")

web.cert.parsed.issuer_dn=~`^C=\w{2},\s+ST=[a-z0-9]{8},\s+L=[a-z0-9]{8},\s+O=[a-z0-9]{8},\sOU=[a-z0-9]{8},\sCN=[a-z0-9]{8}$`

web.hostname=~`.*\.okta.com` and web.labels.value="LOGIN_PAGE" and web.endpoints.http.status_code="200"
```

## Fingerprinting patterns that work well

```text
# HTML attribute - escape the quotes, and precision improves by an order of magnitude
host.services.endpoints.http.body=~`id=\"login_left\"`

# URL-encoded query parameter - no escaping needed, = and % are literal
host.services.endpoints.http.body=~`product=SMA%201000%20Series`

# Server banner prefix - anchor at the start
host.services.banner=~`^220 ProFTPD`

# Header value, bound to its key with nested syntax
host.services.endpoints.http.headers:(key="Server" and value=~`^SMA/`)

# Case-insensitivity via character classes, never (?i)
host.services.endpoints.http.html_title=~`[Ff]ish[Ee]ye and [Cc]rucible 4\.`
```
